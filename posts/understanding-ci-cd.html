                <h2>What is CI/CD?</h2>
                <p>CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (or Continuous Deployment). It's a set of practices and a philosophy that aims to automate the software delivery process, allowing development teams to deliver code changes more frequently and reliably.</p>

                <h3>Continuous Integration (CI)</h3>
                <p>Continuous Integration is the practice of automating the integration of code changes from multiple contributors into a single software project. The primary goal of CI is to prevent integration problems by having developers "integrate" their work as often as possible—at least daily. Each integration is then verified by an automated build (including testing) to detect integration errors as quickly as possible.</p>
                
                <h3>Continuous Delivery (CD)</h3>
                <p>Continuous Delivery is an extension of Continuous Integration. It's a practice where code changes are automatically built, tested, and prepared for a release to a production environment. The final step of deploying to a live production environment is typically a manual trigger. This ensures that even though the software is ready to be deployed at any time, the business can decide the exact moment of release.</p>
                
                <h3>Continuous Deployment (also CD)</h3>
                <p>Continuous Deployment is the most advanced stage of the CI/CD pipeline. It's similar to Continuous Delivery, but instead of a manual trigger, every change that passes all stages of your production pipeline is released to your customers automatically. There's no human intervention, and only a failed test will prevent a new change to be deployed to production.</p>

                <h2>Why is CI/CD Important?</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Reduced Risk:</strong> By integrating and testing smaller changes more frequently, it's easier to identify and fix bugs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Increased Velocity:</strong> Automation allows teams to release new features to users faster.</li>
                    <li><strong>Improved Developer Productivity:</strong> Developers can focus on writing code instead of worrying about the deployment process.</li>
                    <li><strong>Higher Quality Code:</strong> Automated tests and early bug detection lead to more reliable code.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Implementing a robust CI/CD pipeline is a cornerstone of modern DevOps practices and a critical step in building a high-performing engineering organization.</p>
